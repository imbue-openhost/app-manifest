# app-manifest

The official Cloud in a Bottle app catalog feed. Consumed by [`openhost-catalog`](https://github.com/imbue-openhost/openhost-catalog) to populate its app listing.

This repo is data-only. The Go/Python code that reads this feed lives elsewhere.

## Structure

```
catalog.toml          # Catalog-level metadata (source name)
catalog.json          # Generated feed (what consumers fetch)
generate.py           # Builds catalog.json from the TOML sources
apps/<name>/app.toml  # One directory per app
```

## Feed format

The feed follows the `openhost.catalog.v1` schema. Each app entry has:

| Field          | Required | Description |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| `name`         | yes      | The name the app deploys as. Must be lowercase alphanumeric with optional interior hyphens. Drop any `openhost-` prefix. |
| `title`        | yes      | Display name |
| `description`  | yes      | One-line summary |
| `repo_url`     | yes      | GitHub repo containing the app's `openhost.toml` manifest |
| `repo_ref`     | no       | Pin to a branch, tag, or commit (default: repo's default branch) |
| `icon_url`     | no       | URL to an icon image |
| `tags`         | no       | Array of search tags |
| `categories`   | no       | Array of categories |
| `website_url`  | no       | Upstream project homepage |
| `docs_url`     | no       | Documentation link |

The `name` field is the app's identifier in the catalog: it is used in catalog URLs, pre-filled as the default deployed app name when installing, and must be unique within a source.

## Getting into the catalog

There is no numeric integration rating. An app is either in the catalog or it
isn't: it earns its place by passing a review of how well it fits Cloud in a
Bottle — primarily SSO quality, data/secret conventions, and guest handling.
Apps that fall short are fixed or left out rather than shipped as-is.

The checklist a review works through lives in
**[CATALOG_REVIEW_GUIDE.md](CATALOG_REVIEW_GUIDE.md)**.

## Uniqueness

- **Within a source**: every app must have a unique `name` and a unique `repo_url`. Duplicates cause `generate.py` to fail.
- **Across sources**: the same name can appear in multiple source feeds without conflict. They show as separate entries in the catalog.

## Adding an app

Edit `apps/<name>/app.toml` and CI regenerates `catalog.json`.

1. Add or edit `apps/<short-name>/app.toml` with the fields above (local checkout or catalog's add app autofill).
2. Open a pull request.
3. CI runs `generate.py`, which validates the TOML and regenerates
   `catalog.json`:
   - **Branch in this repo:** the fresh `catalog.json` is committed back onto
     your PR branch automatically.
   - **Fork:** CI can't push to your fork, so it only validates; `catalog.json`
     is regenerated on `main` when the PR merges.

   If the TOML is invalid (bad name, unknown category) the check fails with the
   reason.

If you do have a local checkout, you can regenerate ahead of CI with
`python3 generate.py` and commit `catalog.json` yourself — optional, not
required.

## Development

### Regenerate the feed

```bash
python3 generate.py
```

### Check the feed is up to date

```bash
python3 generate.py --check
```

Exits non-zero if `catalog.json` is stale relative to the TOML sources. Used by
the pre-commit hook; CI regenerates instead of checking (see below).

### Verify repos

```bash
python3 generate.py --verify-repos            # all apps
python3 generate.py --verify-repos lila forgejo  # only these apps
```

Queries the GitHub API to confirm each app's `repo_url` points at a reachable,
public repository that contains an `openhost.toml` manifest at its root (on
`repo_ref`, if pinned). Exits non-zero if a repo is missing/private or the
manifest is absent. Network errors (including rate limits) warn but don't fail.
Kept out of the default generate/`--check` path so local runs stay offline. On a
PR, CI verifies only the apps whose `app.toml` changed, so it scales with the
diff rather than the catalog.

**Auth.** The unauthenticated GitHub API allows 60 requests/hr, but a full scan
makes up to two requests per app, so it needs a token. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or
`GH_TOKEN`) to a token — any token works; it only lifts the rate limit and needs
no access to the apps' repos. Locally, `GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) python3
generate.py --verify-repos` works.

**Full catalog scan.** Run the `Catalog` workflow manually from the Actions tab
(`workflow_dispatch`) to scan every repo — it uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
so nothing to configure. The optional `apps` input scans only the named apps.

### Pre-commit hook

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This installs a hook that runs `generate.py --check` before each commit and
blocks stale `catalog.json` from being committed, so a local checkout stays in
sync without waiting for CI.

### CI

The `Catalog` workflow runs `generate.py` on every PR and on pushes to `main`.
It validates the TOML and regenerates `catalog.json` — committing it back to the
PR branch (same-repo) or to `main` on merge (forks) — so contributors never have
to run the generator by hand.
